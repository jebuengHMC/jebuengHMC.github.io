<p>Hello! Thanks for clicking this link👋🏽</p>

<p>This is <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/cis/about-cis/cis-staff/#usg">Jonathan from CIS</a>. For those who haven't met me, I'm part of the <strong>User Support Services team</strong> and provide <strong>IT support</strong> for the college👨🏽‍💻</p>
<ul>
	<li>In <strong>June 2022</strong> I <strong>lost most of my hearing in both ears.</strong>
	<li>My <strong>right ear is still able to hear</strong> although is very <strong>limited</strong>.
	<li>It’s <strong>difficult for me to understand speech in-person</strong> or <strong>over the phone</strong>.
	<li>I am using some <strong>assistive technology</strong> such as <strong>speech-to-text apps</strong> and the iPhone’s <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082"><strong>Live Listen</strong></a> feature to help with my hearing, but I <strong>may still encounter difficulty</strong> verbally communicating with you.
	<li>I am generally able to <strong>hear you</strong> if I'm <strong>right next to you</strong> or if you <strong>face me and project your voice louder</strong> than you usually do when farther away.
	<li>I <strong>can hear reasonably well over the phone</strong> but <strong>occasionally miss some words</strong>.
	<li>I am currently <strong>unable to get a hearing aid</strong> just yet but I am planning to.
	<li>I am practicing <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASL">ASL</strong> and learning about <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture">Deaf culture</a></strong> but am very early in the learning process.

<ul>
	<li>If you <strong>need my attention</strong>, <strong>tap me on the shoulder</strong> or <strong>make eye contact</strong> and <strong>wave</strong> instead of calling my name.
	<li>I may ask you to <strong>repeat yourself</strong> several times
	<li>If I am using a <strong>speech-to-text app</strong>, there might be a <strong>delay</strong> before I understand what you are saying.
	<li><strong>Chat</strong> or <a href="mailto:jebueng@hmc.edu"><strong>email</strong></a> is preferred.
	<li>Talking <strong>one-on-one is preferred</strong>, but if I’m in a <strong>group conversation</strong>, I might <strong>not pick up what everyone is saying</strong> without the help of voice transcription technology.
</ul>
